## Experience
### Chattermill, Berlin - Deep Learning Engineer 
_(September 2019 - present)_

I am responsible for engineering and maintaining the **core machine learning component** of Chattermill’s principal product: our **natural language processing stack on Kubernetes** which analyses customer feedback data at scale.  My role lies at the border between data science and software engineering - ensuring the service is **performing with state-of-the-art** accuracy without compromising on efficiency.
Outside of this, I run and coordinate data science research initiatives on **conversational data, ranking algorithms and abstractive text summarisation** for future products.

### Rasa, Berlin- Machine Learning Engineer 
_(September 2018 - September 2019)_

Machine learning work with a focus on natural language processing: **open source natural language understanding and dialogue management** software for industrial AI assistants.  My projects included **collaborations with the open source community** and optimisation of dialogue policies; in one customer project I was successful in lowering chatbot training times by a **factor of over 100** whilst simultaneously doubling its success rate.

### AKKA Technologies, Paris- Machine Learning Engineer 
_(March 2018 - September 2018)_

Received training on market analysis and consulting skills.  Led a team in designing and presenting an **autonomous waste removal system** to key members of the company.  Following this training, I was relocated to Paris to work on a research project involving the training of a drone to fly autonomously in its environment using **reinforcement learning**.  By leading a small team I also implemented speech, gesture and facial recognition into the drone’s software to enable it to complete more complex tasks.

### Durham University, U.K. - Master’s in Physics
Areas of study including quantum & classical mechanics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, lasers, quantum computing, cosmology & astrophysics.  My Master’s project consisted of classifying cosmic ultra luminous X-ray sources by their electromagnetic spectra, through software I built using Python.
